       Alien Breed 3D - Full screen 1x1 Pixel Mode!!! Yes it`s true!!

Having caught wind of what other people were up to, Andy (coder behind
AB3D) has managed to re-write a lot of the original AB3D engine and now
offers the following features;

NEW ENGINE FEATURES!

The pack will also contain the following;
